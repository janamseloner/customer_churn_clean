📊 Customer Churn Prediction (Streamlit + TensorFlow + Pandas)

Predicting customer churn helps businesses understand which customers are likely to leave and why.
This project builds a customer churn prediction web app using:

TensorFlow / Keras – Neural network model

Pandas – Data preprocessing

Streamlit – Interactive web dashboard

Matplotlib & Seaborn (optional) – Visualizations

🚀 Features

✔️ Load and preprocess customer data
✔️ Train a churn prediction model using TensorFlow
✔️ Real-time predictions through a Streamlit UI
✔️ Data visualizations (distributions, correlations, churn patterns)
✔️ Clean, interactive interface
✔️ Model saved and loaded using .h5 format
